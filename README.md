Healthcare Data Analysis

Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing a healthcare dataset to gain insights into patient demographics, medical conditions, admission trends, billing amounts, and treatment outcomes. The goal is to uncover patterns that can help in optimizing healthcare services and costs.

Dataset Information

1,The dataset contains 55,500 records with the following key attributes:

2,Patient Information: Name, Age, Gender, Blood Type
3,Medical Details: Medical Condition, Medication, Test Results

4,Admission Details: Date of Admission, Discharge Date, Admission Type

5,Healthcare Providers: Doctor, Hospital, Insurance Provider

6,Financial Data: Billing Amount, Room Number

Objectives

Analyze patient demographics and common medical conditions.

Identify trends in hospital admissions and discharge patterns.

Examine the relationship between medical conditions and billing amounts.

Explore the impact of insurance providers on hospital costs.

Predict potential healthcare costs and patient outcomes using machine learning models.
